# Python---Getting-started-with-Natural Language Processing

Hey, I'm Agatha, a beginner programmer, and I'm giving Python a try.

I'm doing my first project using NLP and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to practice what I've learned so far.
(based on Codecademy's skill path: Build Chatbots with Python AND https://www.nltk.org/book/ch03.html)

I got stuff set up on my PC and will try to keep posting stuff to github.
I'm using Sublime Text 4 and found this video helpful for setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFciV6Ew5r4

I hope to do some basic analysis of themes and see where it goes from there. I decided to start with ebooks (Project Gutenburg) since it seemed easy to access but I might switch over to blogs later.

If you have any advice, tips, or questions, let me know.
